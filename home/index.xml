      <description>Here are some interesting facts about myself:
 I am an amateur Go player and a member of the Cornell Go Club. During 2016-2018, I participated in ACGL (American Collegiate Go League), representing Cornell University. I am (officially) a 2-dan amateur Go player and a 4-dan player on Eweiqi. I read books in my spare time, especially science fictions, history, and philosophy books. I am particularly interested in analytic philosophy, philosophy of language and philosophy of mind.</description>

      <description>About Welcome to my homepage! My name is Xun Huang (黄勋 in Chinese, pronounced as /shuun hwang/). I am a fourth-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at Cornell University, affiliated with Cornell Tech at NYC. I am advised by Professor Serge Belongie. My research is focused on deep generative models and applying them to re-create the visual world.
My research has been supported by Adobe Research Fellowship (2019), Snap Research Fellowship (2019), and NVIDIA Graduate Fellowship (2018).</description>
